# canopy-app
Repository for low-level, stand-alone/column canopy codes and parameterizations for application to gridded atmospheric composition models.

Author(s):

Patrick Campbell, Zachary Moon, and Wei-Ting Hung

Compile and run canopy model:
- `make`
- `./canopy`

Current Canopy-App components:

1.  In-Canopy Winds and Wind Adjustment Factor (WAF) for wildland fire spread model applications (Massman et al., 2017).

2 . In-Canopy radiative transfer (i.e., photolysis rate adjusment) calculations (in progress...)  (Makar et al., 2017)

3.  In-Canopy vertical diffusion (i.e., eddy diffusivity adjustment) calculations (in progress...) (Makar et al., 2017)
